## Description

**QA Image iOS** is a dynamic SwiftUI application designed for the iOS platform. Currently, the application functions as an interactive "Activity Randomizer," helping users decide on physical activities or sports to participate in.

The app leverages **SwiftUI's** declarative syntax to render a clean, modern interface that transitions smoothly between different states. It features a curated list of activities (such as Archery, Baseball, and Hiking) and uses **SF Symbols** to display context-aware iconography.

## Features

  * **Activity Generation:** Randomly selects a sport from a predefined list (e.g., Golf, Hiking, Lacrosse).
  * **Dynamic Visuals:** Displays a unique system icon (SF Symbol) and a randomized background color for each selection.
  * **Fluid Animations:** Uses `transition(.slide)` and `withAnimation` to create smooth visual effects when switching between activities.
  * **Native Design:** Built entirely with SwiftUI components (`VStack`, `Circle`, `Button`) for a native iOS feel.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

  * Mac running macOS Sonoma or later.
  * Xcode 16.4 or later.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nikelroid/qa-image-ios.git
    cd qa-image-ios
    ```

2.  **Open the Project:**
    Double-click `QA-image.xcodeproj` to open the project in Xcode.

3.  **Run the App:**

      * Select a simulator (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro) or a connected physical device.
      * Press `Cmd + R` or click the **Run** button in the top toolbar.

## Usage

Upon launching the application:

1.  The screen displays a "Why not try..." header.
2.  A central circle displays an icon representing a sport (e.g., a Baseball figure).
3.  Tap the **"Try again"** button at the bottom.
4.  The app will animate to a new random sport and color.

## Contributing

1.  Fork the project.
2.  Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/NewActivity`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new sports to the list'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/NewActivity`).

### 5\. Detailed File Descriptions

#### `QA-image/ContentView.swift` (Main UI)

This is the core view of the application.

  * **Logic:** Defines an array of `activities` (Strings) and `colors`. It maintains `@State` variables to track the currently selected activity and the view ID to trigger animations.
  * **UI Structure:** Uses a `VStack` to arrange the title, the main visual (a colored `Circle` overlaid with an `Image` system icon), and the trigger `Button`.
  * **Animation:** The "Try again" button triggers a `withAnimation` block that randomizes the selection and increments the `id`, causing the transition effect.

#### `QA-image/QA_imageApp.swift` (Entry Point)

The application entry point marked with `@main`.

  * It initializes the `QA_imageApp` struct conforming to the `App` protocol.
  * It creates a `WindowGroup` that hosts the `ContentView`, launching the UI when the app starts.

#### `QA-image.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` (Project Configuration)

The internal Xcode configuration file.

  * **Deployment Target:** Sets `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to `18.5`.
  * **Swift Version:** Specifies `SWIFT_VERSION = 5.0`.
  * **Organization:** Defines the bundle identifier as `com.nikelroid.QA-image`.

#### `QA-image/Assets.xcassets` (Resources)

Contains the visual assets for the project.

  * **`AppIcon.appiconset`**: Defines the application icons for various iOS device sizes.
  * **`AccentColor.colorset`**: Defines the global tint color for the app.

#### `QA-imageUITests` & `QA-imageTests` (Testing)

Contains boilerplate test classes generated by Xcode.

  * **`QA_imageUITests.swift`**: Includes a `testLaunchPerformance` metric test to measure application startup time.
